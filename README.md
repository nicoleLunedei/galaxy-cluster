# Galaxy-Cluster
The goal of this project is to understand and investingate the behaviour of a galaxy cluster starting to obtain the density profile of the gas density within the cluster, in idrostatic equilibrium. The following are the cases with different approximations:
- The main contribution of gravity is given by the presence of dark matter and the gas is in isothermal equilibrium
- It is considered also the contribution of the big central galaxy and still the gas is in isothermal equilibrium
- The gas is no longer in isothermal equilibrium and it is introduced the thermal gradient 
- It is considered a small turbolence which becomes a second contribution to the pressure.
  
In the second part it is studied the metallicity aspect of the cluster. In particolar, under the assumptions that the origin is the explosion of SNIa and the presence of high energy sources, like an AGN inside the Big Central Galaxy, it will be studied the metallicity profile.
