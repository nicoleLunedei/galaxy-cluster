# Galaxy-Cluster
The goal of this project is to under stand and investingate the behaviour of a galaxy cluster starting to obtain the density profile of the gas density within the cluster, in idrostatic equilibrium. The following are the cases with different approximations:
- The main contribution of gravity is given by the presence of dark matter and the gas is in isothermal equilibrium
- It is considered also the contribution of the big central galaxy and still the gas is in isothermal equilibrium
- The gas is no longer in isothermal equilibrium and it is introduced the thermal gradient 
- It is considered a small turbolence which becomes a second contribution to the pressure
